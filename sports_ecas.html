        <li><h4>Hockey</h4>
            <p>I have been playing hockey for my entire life. Cuttently, I play for the 
                Navy Men's Hockey A team as the starting goalie. The season goes from August
                to March so they keep us pretty busy pretty much all year round. We are a D1
                club team playing in the ACHA hockey association.

        <li><h4>Chess</h4></li>
            <p>I am an avid chess player. I mostly play online but I do participate in the 
                Chess club at USNA. Currently my ELO is ~1350 but I am working hard to improve.
                Chess is a super fun <s>rabbithole</s> game that I highly reccommend.
            </p>
        <li><h4>JAC</h4></li>
            <p>Growing up in Japan and having an Asian heritage, I have a respect and understanding
                of Japanese culture. I express this interest through invovement with the Japanese
                American Club at USNA.
