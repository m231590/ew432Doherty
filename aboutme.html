    <h4>Who am I?</h4>
    <p>As written on the main page, I am a Midshipman at the Naval Academy in my 3rd year. I play hockey
        as my sport, do Robotics and Control Systems for my major, and play chess as a hobby. I was born
        in Chicago, Illinois, but I grew up in Tokyo, Japan. I was there for 9 years until the 2011 Earthquake,
        when my parents decided to move back to Chicago. My family is actually in the process of moving again,
        and we are setting up to be in Las Vegas, Nevada. The picture bellow shows me on a hiking trail outside
        of Vegas.
